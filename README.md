# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Authentication System

This app includes a role-based authentication system that connects to an external API. The system supports:

- User login and registration
- Role-based access (employer, isci, worker)
- Secure token storage
- Automatic token refresh
- Persistent sessions

### API Configuration

Before running the app, you need to configure the API URL:

1. Open `hooks/useAuth.js`
2. Update the `API_URL` constant with your authentication API endpoint:

```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://your-api-endpoint.com'; // Replace with your actual API URL
```

### API Requirements

Your authentication API should support the following endpoints:

- `POST /auth/login`: For user login
  - Request: `{ email, password, role }`
  - Response: `{ token, user: { email, role, ... } }`

- `POST /auth/register`: For user registration
  - Request: `{ email, password, role }`
  - Response: `{ token, user: { email, role, ... } }`

- `POST /auth/refresh`: For token refresh
  - Request: `{ token }`
  - Response: `{ token }`

- `POST /auth/logout`: For user logout (optional)

### Security

User authentication tokens are securely stored using `expo-secure-store`, which provides encrypted storage on the device. User data is also stored securely and is automatically loaded when the app starts.
